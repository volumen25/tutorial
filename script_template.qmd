# Script Template

Please use the following template to write your code or build your own template that suits your purpose. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure your work is professional and readable. As Python creator Guido van Rossum once noted, code is read far more frequently than it is written. 

```python

Please replace this text with a concise description of the script’s purpose.
For example, you can type in:
Determines the volumetric and mass flow rates in a pipe carrying oil,
given the internal diameter, fluid velocity, and relative density.

# INPUT PARAMETERS
# ==============================

pipe_internal_diameter_mm = 75.0  # Use descriptive variable names with units
oil_velocity_m_per_s = 1.2  # Include meaningful inline comments
oil_relative_density = 0.9  # Include meaningful inline comments
water_density_kg_per_m3 = 1000.0  # Density of water in kg/m³

# ==============================
# UNIT CONVERSIONS AND GEOMETRY
# ==============================

# Convert pipe diameter from millimeters to meters
pipe_internal_diameter_m = pipe_internal_diameter_mm / 1000.0

# Calculate pipe radius
pipe_radius_m = pipe_internal_diameter_m / 2.0

# Calculate cross-sectional area of the pipe (circular)
pipe_cross_sectional_area_m2 = math.pi * pipe_radius_m**2

# ==============================
# FLOW RATE CALCULATIONS
# ==============================

# Calculate volumetric flow rate
# Restrict line length to a maximum of 79 characters 
# to ensure compatibility with print media and prevent horizontal overflow.
volumetric_flow_rate_m3_per_s = (
    pipe_cross_sectional_area_m2 * oil_velocity_m_per_s

# Calculate oil density from relative density
oil_density_kg_per_m3 = oil_relative_density * water_density_kg_per_m3

# Calculate mass flow rate
mass_flow_rate_kg_per_s = oil_density_kg_per_m3 * volumetric_flow_rate_m3_per_s

# Convert mass flow rate to tonnes per hour
mass_flow_rate_tonnes_per_hour = mass_flow_rate_kg_per_s * 3600 / 1000
