# Summary of Key Terms

## Inertia

The tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion. An object with greater mass has greater inertia (it is “harder to start or stop”).

-   In **Naval Architecture**, the *moment of inertia* (units: $m⁴$) is a measure of resistance to bending (related to stiffness/deflection of beams and hull girders).
-   In **angular motion and physics**, the *moment of inertia* (units: kg·m²) is a measure of resistance to angular acceleration (rotational inertia).

## Linear Momentum (p)

Momentum is the “quantity of motion” an object has. It is calculated as:

$$p = m v$$

where

-   $p$ = linear momentum (kg·m/s)

-   $m$ = mass (kg)

-   $v$ = velocity (m/s)

Momentum is a **vector quantity** (it has both magnitude and direction).

## Newton’s Laws of Motion

### First Law (Law of Inertia)

An object will stay at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless an unbalanced (net) external force acts on it.

### Second Law (Law of Acceleration)

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

$$F_{\text{net}} = m a \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m}$$

### Third Law (Action-Reaction)

Whenever two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other.\
“For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.”

## Conservation of Linear Momentum

If no external forces act on a system (or if the external forces cancel out), the total momentum of the system stays constant.

In collisions or explosions:

**Total momentum before = Total momentum after**

Example: When two objects collide and stick together or bounce apart, the momentum lost by one is exactly gained by the other, so the total remains the same.

## Angular Momentum

The rotational equivalent of linear momentum. It describes how much “rotational motion” a spinning or orbiting object has.

Angular momentum depends on mass, speed, and distance from the axis of rotation.

## Radius of Gyration (k)

A geometric property of a rigid body that indicates how the mass is distributed relative to a specified axis of rotation. It is defined such that:

$$I = m k^2$$

where

-   $I$ = moment of inertia (kg·m²)

-   $m$ = total mass (kg)

-   $k$ = radius of gyration (m)

### Practical Examples for Radius of Gyration

-   **Smaller** $k$ → mass is concentrated closer to the axis → **lower** rotational inertia\
    → easier/faster to speed up or slow down rotation\
    (e.g., engine crankshafts, turbine rotors).

-   **Larger** $k$ → mass is distributed farther from the axis → **higher** rotational inertia\
    → better for storing rotational energy\
    (e.g., flywheels; a hollow cylinder has a larger $k$ than a solid cylinder of the same mass and outer radius).
