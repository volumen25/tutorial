# IC Engines {#ic_engines}

Internal combustion (IC) engines\index{IC Engines} derive their name from fuel burning inside the engine cylinder. The combustion heats the air in the cylinder, increasing its pressure and moving the piston, whose reciprocating motion is converted to rotary motion by the crankshaft.

IC engines are classified by their ignition method:

-   Compression Ignition: Air is highly compressed, raising its temperature so injected fuel ignites spontaneously.

-   Spark Ignition: A fuel–air mixture is compressed and then ignited by a spark plug.

## Engine Performance Calculations

-   **Length of diagram**: 68 mm
-   **Fuel consumption**: 3.5 kg/h
-   **Calorific value of fuel**: 44 MJ/kg
-   **Cooling water supplied**: 2.5 kg/min
-   **Temperature rise of cooling water**: 40°C

Calculate: (i) Mechanical efficiency (ii) Indicated thermal efficiency (iii) Draw up an energy balance account on a basis of 1 minute.

### Mechanical Efficiency

**Brake Power (BP):**

Torque: τ = W × r = 52 × 9.81 × 0.75 = 382.59 Nm\
Angular velocity: ω = 2π × 270/60 = 28.2743 rad/s\
BP = τ × ω = 382.59 × 28.2743 = 10.8175 kW\

**Indicated Power (IP):**

Mean effective pressure: Pm = (340/68) × 120 = 600.0000 kPa\
Piston area: A = (π/4) × (0.22)² = 0.038013 m²\
Speed (4-stroke): n = 270/(2×60) = 2.2500 rev/s\
IP = Pm × A × L × n = 600.0 × 0.038013 × 0.4 × 2.2500 = 20.5272 kW\

**Mechanical Efficiency:** ηₘ = (BP/IP) × 100% = (10.8175/20.5272) × 100% = **52.70%**

### Indicated Thermal Efficiency

SFOCᵢ = 3.5/20.5272 = 0.1705 kg/kWh\
ηₜₕ = 3.6/(SFOCᵢ × CV) = 3.6/(0.1705 × 44) = **47.99%**\
