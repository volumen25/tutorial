## Objectives

-   Distinguish between scalar and vector quantities.
-   Define equilibrium of an object.
-   Practice vector problems.

## Concepts

In mathematics and physics, a **scalar**\index{scalar} is a quantity with only magnitude (size), whereas a **vector**\index{vector} has both magnitude and direction. Examples of scalar quantities include numbers, mass, speed, temperature, volume, and time. In contrast, examples of vector quantities include velocity, acceleration, and forces like weight and friction.

A vector is represented as an arrow, where the length denotes its magnitude, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Vector diagrams are useful for visually conveying information about vector relationships, allowing us to analyze effects like the combination of forces or the movement of objects in two or three dimensions. In such diagrams, vectors are often drawn to scale and placed with respect to an origin or another reference point.

## Coplanar Forces

Coplanar forces are forces that act within the same plane. This means they lie along a single, flat surface, and their lines of action do not extend out of that plane. Coplanar forces are often analyzed together in physics and engineering because their combined effects can be resolved within two dimensions.

## Cartesian Coordinates

In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system\index{Cartesian coordinate system}, a point is represented as $(x, y)$, where:

-   $x$ is the horizontal distance from the origin ($the\ x-coordinate$).

-   $y$ is the vertical distance from the origin ($the\ y-coordinate$).

The distance $r$ of a point $(x, y)$ from the origin can be calculated using:

$$
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$ {#eq-cartesian1}

The angle $\theta$ between the positive $(x)-axis$ and the line joining the origin to the point can be found as:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$ {#eq-cartesian2}

## Cosine Rule

![Rules of Cosine and Sine](images/sinecosrule.png){#fig-law_cos_sine}

The Cosine Rule\index{Cosine rule} is used to relate the lengths of the sides of a triangle as shown in @fig-law_cos_sine to the cosine of one of its angles:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos \gamma
$$ {#eq-cos}

Where:

-   a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

-   $\gamma$ is the angle opposite side c.

## Sine Rule

The Sine Rule\index{Sine rule} relates the sides and angles of a triangle in @fig-law_cos_sine:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma}
$$ {#eq-sine}

Where:

-   $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are the angles of the triangle.

-   a, b, c are the sides of the triangle opposite to angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ respectively.

Calculate the resultant of the forces 0.7 kN at 147° and 1.3 kN at -71° by using the cosine\index{Cosine rule} and sine rules\index{Sine rule}.

Given the following forces:

-   Force 1, $F_1 = 0.7 \ \text{kN} , \ at \  147^\circ$,
-   Force 2, $F_2 = 1.3 \ \text{kN} , \ at -71^\circ$.

The angle between the two forces is:

$$
\theta = 147^\circ - (-71^\circ) = 147^\circ + 71^\circ = 218^\circ
$$

Since $( 218^\circ > 180^\circ), we\ subtract\ from \ 360^\circ$ to get the smaller angle:

$$
\theta = 360^\circ - 218^\circ = 142^\circ
$$

Step 1: Using the Cosine Rule to Find the Resultant Magnitude

The magnitude of the resultant $R$ is given by the cosine rule:

$$
R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos(\theta)}.
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
R = \sqrt{(0.7)^2 + (1.3)^2 + 2(0.7)(1.3)\cos(142^\circ)}.
$$

We calculate $\cos142^\circ$:

$$
\cos(142^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ - 38^\circ) = -\cos(38^\circ) \approx -0.788.
$$

Now substitute into the formula for ( R ):

$$
R = \sqrt{0.49 + 1.69 - 1.432}.
$$

$$
R = \sqrt{0.748} \approx 0.865 \, \text{kN}.
$$

Step 2: Using the Sine Rule to Find the Direction

The direction of the resultant $\alpha$ relative to $F_1$ is found using the sine rule:

$$
\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{F_2} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{R}.
$$

We calculate $\sin142^\circ$:

$$
\sin(142^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ - 142^\circ) = \sin(38^\circ) \approx 0.616.
$$

Now apply the sine rule:

$$
\sin(\alpha) = \frac{1.3 \times 0.616}{0.865} \approx 0.926.
$$

Thus, $\alpha \approx 67.9^\circ$.

The direction of the resultant relative to the positive x-axis is:

$$
\text{Direction} = 147^\circ - 67.9^\circ = 79.1^\circ.
$$

## Space Diagrams

The space diagram is an illustration of the system of forces.

## Vector Diagrams

The vector diagram is a diagram drawn to scale with the vectors joined end to end. Vector diagrams are used to analyze and combine forces to find the resultant.

![Vector Diagram](images/vectordia.png){#fig-vectordia}

### Resultant

The resultant is a single force that represents the combined effect of two or more forces acting on an object. It has the same effect as applying all the original forces together and is found by adding the individual forces, taking both their magnitudes and directions into account. The resultant gives the overall direction and magnitude of the combined forces as shown in @fig-vectordia.

### Equilibrium

Equilibrium of an object occurs when all the forces acting on it are balanced, so the object remains at rest or moves at a constant speed in a straight line. In equilibrium, there is no net force or acceleration, meaning the object is in a stable state without any change in its motion.

![Equilibrant](images/vectordia-equilibrant.png){#fig-equilibrant}

Conditions of equilibrium:

1.  Net force must be zero:

$$
\sum_{k} \vec{F}_{k} = \vec{0}
$$ {#eq-force}

2.  Net torque must be zero:

$$
\sum_{k} \vec{\tau}_{k} = \vec{0}
$$ {#eq-torque}

## Slings

A sling is a device or assembly of ropes, cables, or straps used to support and lift loads. Slings play a crucial role in rigging operations, allowing objects to be lifted, lowered, or moved safely and efficiently. Slings are arranged to distribute the load evenly across their length, reducing stress points and ensuring stability. In multi-leg slings (e.g., two-leg or four-leg), the load is shared among the sling legs, which helps stabilize and balance the load.

A 200 kg mass is suspended as shown in @fig-sling. Rope A is attached to a beam in two places and is passed through a ring that rest naturally at the centre of rope A. Rope B is attached to the bottom of the ring, and to the 200 kg mass.

![A 200 kg suspended mass.](images/sling.png){#fig-sling}

a.  What is the tension in rope B?
b.  Draw a free body diagram of the forces exerted on the ring.
c.  What is the tension in rope A?

Given Information

-   Mass $m = 200 \, \text{kg}$
-   Gravitational acceleration $g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$
-   Angle $\theta = 25^\circ$

a.  Tension in Rope B

The tension $T_B$ in Rope B must support the entire weight of the mass. Therefore,

$$
T_B = m \cdot g = 200 \times 9.81 = 1962 \, \text{N}
$$

So, **the tension in Rope B is 1962 N**.

b.  Free Body Diagram of the Ring

The ring is in equilibrium, meaning the net force acting on it is zero. Here’s a breakdown of the forces:

-   **Tension** $T_B$: Acts downward, equal to the weight of the 200 kg mass.
-   **Tensions** $T_{A1}$ and $T_{A2}$: These are the tensions in each side of Rope A. Since the ring is at the center and the setup is symmetrical, $T_{A1} = T_{A2} = T_A$.

Since the ring is in equilibrium, the vertical components of $T_{A1}$ and $T_{A2}$ must balance the downward force from $T_B$.

c.  Tension in Rope A

Since the angle between each side of Rope A and the horizontal is $\theta = 25^\circ$, we can use trigonometry to find $T_A$.

The equilibrium condition is:

$$
2 \cdot T_A \cdot \sin(\theta) = T_B
$$

Solving for $T_A$:

$$
T_A = \frac{T_B}{2 \sin(\theta)}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
T_A = \frac{1962}{2 \cdot \sin(25^\circ)}
$$

Calculating:

$$
T_A \approx 2321.24 \, \text{N}
$$

So, **the tension in Rope A is approximately 2321.24 N**.
