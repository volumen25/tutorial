# Dynamics {#dynamics}

Dynamics is the branch of mechanics that studies the motion of bodies under the action of forces. This chapter examines situations where forces produce acceleration, and it presents methods for analyzing the resulting motion, including the application of Newton’s laws, energy principles, and momentum conservation.

## Linear Motion

$$
\vec{v} = \vec{u} + \vec{a}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \frac{\vec{u}+\vec{v}}{2}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \vec{u}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2
$$

$$
\vec{v}^2 = \vec{u}^2 + 2\vec{a} \cdot \vec{s}
$$

where:

-   $\vec{u}$: Initial velocity
-   $\vec{v}$: Final velocity
-   $\vec{s}$: Displacement
-   $\vec{a}$: Acceleration
-   $t$: Time

## Angular Motion

$$
\omega_2 = \omega_1 \mp \alpha t
$$

$$
\theta = \frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}t
$$

$$
\theta = \omega_1 t \mp \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2 
$$

$$
\omega_2^2 = \omega_1^2 \mp 2\alpha \theta
$$

where:

-   $\omega_1$: Initial angular velocity (rad/s)

-   $\omega_2$: Final angular velocity (rad/s)

-   $\theta$ Angular displacement (rad)

-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration (rad/s^2^)

-   $t$: Time (s)

## Relation Between Linear and Angular Motion

The relationship between linear and angular motion is described by the following equations:

$s = r \theta$ (linear displacement $s$ and angular displacement $\theta$).

$v = r \omega$ (linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\omega$),

$a = r \alpha$ (linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$).

## Linear momentum

$$
Linear\ momentum = m \vec{v}
$$

Where:

-   Linear momentum is in kg·m/s.

-   $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms.

-   $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the object in meters per second.

## Angular momentum

$$ \text{Angular momentum} = I \omega $$

Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.
-   $\omega$ is the angular velocity in $rad/s$.

## Moment of inertia

$$ 
I = m k^2 
$$

Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.
-   $m$ is the mass in $kg$.
-   $k$ is the radius of gyration in $m$.

## Turning moment

$$ 
\tau = I \alpha 
$$

Where:

-   $\tau$ is the torque in $Nm$.
-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.
-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration in $rad/s^2$.

## Power by Torque

$$
P = \tau \cdot \omega
$$

Where:

$P$ is the power in watts (W),

$\tau$ is the torque in newton-meters (Nm), and

$\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

## Kinetic Energy of Rotation

$$
\text{Rotational K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
$$ Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.

-   $\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

::: {#exm-river}
A boat is rowed at **6 km/h** perpendicular to a river flowing at **4 km/h**. The river is **50 meters** wide. How far downstream will the boat reach the opposite bank? What is the boat’s actual velocity (magnitude and direction)?

We treat this as vector addition: the boat's rowing velocity across the river and the river's current velocity downstream.

Given

-   Boat speed across: $v_b = 6\ \text{km/h}$

-   River current speed: $v_c = 4\ \text{km/h}$

-   River width: $w = 50\ \text{m}$

Convert speeds to m/s:

$$
1\ \text{km/h} = \frac{1000}{3600} = 0.277777\ \text{m/s}
$$

$$
v_b = 6 \times 0.277777 = 1.6666667\ \text{m/s}
$$

$$
v_c = 4 \times 0.277777 = 1.1111111\ \text{m/s}
$$

Time to cross the river

$$
t = \frac{w}{v_b} = \frac{50}{1.6666667} = 30\ \text{s}
$$

Downstream drift

$$
\text{drift} = v_c \times t = 1.1111111 \times 30 = 33.3333\ \text{m}
$$

Actual velocity magnitude $$
v = \sqrt{v_b^2 + v_c^2} = 2.00308\ \text{m/s}
$$

Direction (downstream from perpendicular)

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\!\left( \frac{v_c}{v_b} \right) = 33.69
$$

``` python
import math

# Given
boat_speed_kmh = 6      # km/h (perpendicular to river)
current_speed_kmh = 4   # km/h (downstream)
width = 50              # meters (river width)

# Convert speeds to m/s

boat_speed = boat_speed_kmh * 1000 / 3600
current_speed = current_speed_kmh * 1000 / 3600

# Time to cross

t = width / boat_speed

# Downstream drift

drift = current_speed * t

# Actual velocity (magnitude)

v_actual = math.sqrt(boat_speed**2 + current_speed**2)

# Convert to km/h

v_actual_kmh = v_actual * 3.6

# Direction (downstream from perpendicular)

theta_deg = math.degrees(math.atan(current_speed / boat_speed))

print(f"Time to cross: {t:.2f} s")
print(f"Downstream drift: {drift:.2f} m")
print(f"Actual speed: {v_actual:.2f} m/s ({v_actual_kmh:.2f} km/h)")
print(f"Direction: {theta_deg:.2f} degrees downstream")

::: {#exm-ships}
Two ships are moving toward each other in still water. Ship 1 is **310 meters long** and travelling at **22 knots**, while Ship 2 is **350 meters long** and travelling at **19 knots**. Calculate the time it takes for the ships to completely pass each other..

``` python
import math

# Given

length1 = 310   # meters (Ship 1)
length2 = 350   # meters (Ship 2)
speed1 = 22     # knots
speed2 = 19     # knots

# Total distance to be closed (sum of lengths)

distance_m = length1 + length2  # meters

# Convert meters to nautical miles

distance_nm = distance_m / 1852

# Relative (closing) speed in knots

speed_rel = speed1 + speed2

# Time in hours

time_hours = distance_nm / speed_rel

# Convert to seconds
time_seconds = time_hours * 3600

print(f"Time for the ships to pass each other: {time_seconds:.2f} seconds")
```
