## Problem Statement

Calculate the quantity of heat conducted per hour through a duralumin circular disc with the following properties:

-   Diameter: 100 mm
-   Thickness: 20 mm
-   Temperature drop: 10°C
-   Thermal conductivity of duralumin: 150 W/mK

## Solution

The heat conduction rate is given by Fourier’s law:

$$
Q = \frac{k A \Delta T}{s}
$$

where:

-   $Q$ is the heat conducted per second (W),
-   $k$ = 150 W/mK (thermal conductivity),
-   $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the disc,
-   $∆ T$ = 10 °C (temperature difference),
-   $s$ = 20 mm = 0.02 m (thickness of the disc).

### Step 1: Compute the Cross-Sectional Area

The cross-sectional area of the disc is:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

Given the diameter d = 100 mm, the radius is:

$$
 r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ mm} = 0.05 \text{ m}
$$

Thus,

$$
A = \pi (0.05)^2 = \pi \times 0.0025 = 0.00785 \text{ m}^2
$$

### Step 2: Compute the Heat Transfer Rate

Substituting the values into Fourier’s law:

$$
Q = \frac{150 \times 0.00785 \times 10}{0.02}
$$

$$
Q = \frac{11.775}{0.02} = 588.75 \text{ W}
$$

### Step 3: Compute the Heat Conducted per Hour

Since ( 1 ) hour = ( 3600 ) seconds:

$$
Q_{\text{hour}} = 588.75 \times 3600
$$

$$
Q_{\text{hour}} = 2.1195 \times 10^6 \text{ J}
$$

## Final Answer

The quantity of heat conducted per hour through the duralumin disc is **2.12 MJ**.
