# Hydrostatics {#hydrostatics}

Hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at rest and the forces and pressures they exert on immersed or containing surfaces. Key principles include Pascal’s law (pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions), Archimedes’ principle (buoyant force on a submerged body equals the weight of displaced fluid), and the hydrostatic pressure distribution in a fluid column, expressed as $p = \rho g h$, where $p$ is gauge pressure, $\rho$ is fluid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is depth below the free surface.

A vertical rectangular bulkhead is 7 m wide and extends over the full height of the water column. Fresh water stands 6 m deep on one side and is assumed to be at zero level on the other side. Calculate the total hydrostatic load (thrust) on the bulkhead. Density of fresh water = 1000 kg/m³.

```python
# Given
width          = 7.0    # m (horizontal width of bulkhead)
height_water   = 6.0    # m (water depth on one side)
rho_water      = 1000.0 # kg/m³ (fresh water)
g              = 9.81   # m/s²

# Calculations
area           = width * height_water                    # m²
h_centroid     = height_water / 2                        # m (from free surface)
force_N        = rho_water * g * h_centroid * area       # Newtons
force_kN       = force_N / 1000

A 10-meter-long, 4-meter-wide, and 6-meter-high tank is filled with oil (specific gravity = 0.9). The oil rises 5 meters up a vent pipe above the tank’s top. Calculate the load on one end plate and the bottom of the tank.

A vertical rectangular bulkhead, 2 meters wide, divides two liquids in a tank. On one side, oil with a density of 850 kg/m³ stands 4 meters deep.  On the other side, fresh water with a density of 1000 kg/m³ is 6 meters deep. The bottom of the bulkhead rests on the tank bottom, and both liquids are open to the atmosphere at the top, resulting in zero gauge pressure at the free surfaces. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the net hydrostatic thrust on the bulkhead.
