## Problem Statement

The inner surface of a plane brick wall is at 40 °C and the outer surface is at 20 °C. Calculate the rate of heat transfer per square meter of surface area of the wall, which is 250 mm thick. The thermal conductivity of the brick is 0.52 W/mK.

## Given Data

-   Inner surface temperature: $T_1 = 40\,^{\circ}C$
-   Outer surface temperature: $T_2 = 20\,^{\circ}C$
-   Thickness of the wall: $s = 250\, \text{mm} = 0.25\, \text{m}$
-   Thermal conductivity: $k = 0.52\, \text{W/mK}$

## Solution

The rate of heat transfer per unit area through a plane wall is given by Fourier’s law:

$$ q = \frac{k (T_1 - T_2)}{s} $$

Substituting the given values:

$$
q = \frac{0.52 \times (40 - 20)}{0.25}
$$

$$
q = \frac{0.52 \times 20}{0.25}
$$

$$
q = \frac{10.4}{0.25} = 41.6 \text{ W/m}^2
$$

## Final Answer

The rate of heat transfer per square meter of surface area of the wall is **41.6 W/m²**.
