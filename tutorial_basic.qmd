# Python Tutorial {.unnumbered}

This tutorial introduces Python programming, covering basic concepts with examples to illustrate key points. We will start by using Python as a calculator, then explore variables, functions, and control flow.

## Requirements

To follow this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is by using a web-based Python environment. This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend [python-fiddle.com](https://python-fiddle.com/), an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.

If you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.10 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code. I recommend [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), a beginner-friendly IDE with a built-in terminal, though other editors like VS Code or PyCharm are also good options.

## Basic Syntax

Python uses indentation\index{indentation} (typically four spaces) to define code blocks. A colon\index{colon} (`:`) introduces a block, and statements within the block must be indented consistently. Python is case-sensitive, so `Variable` and `variable` are distinct identifiers. *Statements typically end with a newline, but you can use a backslash (`\`) to continue a statement across multiple lines.*

``` python
total = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
print(total)  # Output: 15
```

Basic syntax rules:

-   Comments start with `#` and extend to the end of the line.
-   Strings can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line strings.
-   Python is case-sensitive, so `Variable` and `variable` are different identifiers.

## The `print()` Function

The `print()` function\index{print} displays output in Python.

``` python
name = "Rudolf Diesel"
year = 1858
print(f"{name} was born in {year}.")
```

Output: `Rudolf Diesel was born in 1858.`

The following table illustrates common f-string formatting options for the `print()` function:

| Format | Code | Example | Output |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Round to 2 decimals** | `f"{x:.2f}"` | `print(f"{3.1415:.2f}")` | `3.14` |
| **Round to whole number** | `f"{x:.0f}"` | `print(f"{3.9:.0f}")` | `4` |
| **Thousands separator** | `f"{x:,.2f}"` | `print(f"{1234.567:,.2f}")` | `1,234.57` |
| **Percentage** | `f"{x:.1%}"` | `print(f"{0.756:.1%}")` | `75.6%` |
| **Currency (JPY)** | `f"¥{x:,.0f}"` | `print(f"¥{1234:,.0f}")` | `¥1,234` |

## Variables and Data Types

Variables\index{variables} store data and are assigned values using the `=` operator.

``` python
x = 10
y = 3.14
name = "Rudolph"
```

Python has several built-in data types, including:

-   Integers (`int`): Whole numbers, e.g., `10`, `-5`
-   Floating-point numbers (`float`): Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`
-   Strings (`str`): Text, e.g., `"Hello"`, `'World'`
-   Booleans (`bool`): `True` or `False`

### Arithmetic Operations

``` python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.3333...
print(a // b) # Integer Division: 3
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000
```

### String Operations

``` python
first_name = "Rudolph"
last_name = "Diesel"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # Concatenation using +
print(full_name)  # Output: Rudolph Diesel
print(f"{first_name} {last_name}")  # Concatenation using f-string
print(full_name * 2)  # Repetition: Rudolph DieselRudolph Diesel
print(full_name.upper())  # Uppercase: RUDOLPH DIESEL
```

Note: String repetition (`*`) concatenates the string multiple times without spaces. For example, `full_name * 2` produces `Rudolph DieselRudolph Diesel`.

## Python as a Calculator in Interactive Mode

Python's interactive mode allows you to enter commands and see results immediately, ideal for quick calculations. To start, open a terminal (on macOS, Linux, or Windows) and type:

``` bash
python3  # Use 'python' on Windows if 'python3' is not recognized
```

You should see the Python prompt:

``` bash
>>>
```

Enter expressions and press **Enter** to see results:

``` python
2 + 3  # Output: 5
7 - 4  # Output: 3
6 * 9  # Output: 54
8 / 2  # Output: 4.0
8 // 2 # Output: 4
2 ** 3 # Output: 8
```

### Parentheses for Grouping

``` python
(2 + 3) * 4  # Output: 20
2 + (3 * 4)  # Output: 14
```

### Variables

``` python
x = 10
y = 3
x / y  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
```

### Exiting Interactive Mode

To exit, type:

``` python
exit()
```

Alternatively, use: - **Ctrl+D** (macOS/Linux) - **Ctrl+Z** then Enter (Windows)

## Control Flow

Control flow\index{control flow} statements direct the execution of code based on conditions.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements\index{conditional statements} allow you to execute different code blocks based on specific conditions. Python provides three keywords for this purpose:

-   **`if`**: Evaluates a condition and executes its code block if the condition is `True`.
-   **`elif`**: Short for "else if," it checks an additional condition if the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are `False`. You can use multiple `elif` statements to test multiple conditions sequentially, and Python will execute the first `True` condition’s block, skipping the rest.
-   **`else`**: Executes a code block if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`. It serves as a fallback and does not require a condition.

The following example uses age to categorize a person as a Minor, Adult, or Senior, demonstrating how `if`, `elif`, and `else` work together.

``` python
# Categorize a person based on their age
age = 19
if age < 18:
    print("Minor")
elif age <= 64:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")
```

Output: `Adult`

### For Loop

A `for` loop\index{for loop} iterates over a sequence (e.g., list or string).

``` python
components = ["piston", "liner", "connecting rod"]
for component in components:
    print(component)
```

Output:

```         
piston
liner
connecting rod
```

### While Loop

A `while` loop\index{while loop} executes as long as a condition is true. Ensure the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.

``` python
count = 0
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:

```         
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Functions

### The `def` Keyword

Functions are reusable code blocks defined using the `def` keyword\index{def keyword}. They can include default parameters for optional arguments.

``` python
def add(a, b=0):
    return a + b
print(add(5))      # Output: 5
print(add(5, 3))   # Output: 8

def multiply(*args):
    result = 1
    for num in args:
        result *= num
    return result
print(multiply(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 24
```

### The `lambda` Keyword

The `lambda` keyword\index{lambda keyword} creates anonymous functions for short, one-off operations, often used in functional programming.

``` python
celsius_to_fahrenheit = lambda c: (c * 9 / 5) + 32
print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(25))  # Output: 77.0
```

## The `math` Module

The `math` module\index{math module} provides mathematical functions and constants.

``` python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print(math.pi)        # Output: 3.141592653589793
```

``` python
import math
angle = math.pi / 4  # 45 degrees in radians
print(math.sin(angle))  # Output: 0.7071067811865475
print(math.cos(angle))  # Output: 0.7071067811865476
print(math.tan(angle))  # Output: 1.0
```

Note: Floating-point arithmetic may result in small precision differences, as seen in the `sin` and `cos` outputs.

``` python
import math
print(math.log(10))       # Natural logarithm of 10: 2.302585092
print(math.log(100, 10))  # Logarithm of 100 with base 10: 2.0
```

### Converting Between Radians and Degrees

The `math` module provides `math.radians()` to convert degrees to radians and `math.degrees()` to convert radians to degrees, which is useful for trigonometric calculations.

::: callout-warning
In Python, the trigonometric functions in the `math` module (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.) expect angles in radians, not degrees. Always convert degrees to radians before using these functions.
:::

``` python
import math
degrees = 180
radians = math.radians(degrees)
print(f"{degrees} degrees is {radians:.3f} radians")
radians = math.pi
degrees = math.degrees(radians)
print(f"{radians:.3f} radians is {degrees:.1f} degrees")
```

## Writing Python Scripts

Write Python code in a `.py` file and run it as a script. Create a file named `script.py`:

``` python
# script.py
import math
print("Square root of 16 is:", math.sqrt(16))
print("Value of pi is:", math.pi)
print("Sine of 90 degrees is:", math.sin(math.pi / 2))
print("Natural logarithm of 10 is:", math.log(10))
print("Logarithm of 100 with base 10 is:", math.log(100, 10))
```

To run the script, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `script.py` using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd /path/to/directory`), and type:

``` bash
python3 script.py  # or python script.py on Windows
```

Output:

```         
Square root of 16 is: 4.0
Value of pi is: 3.141592653589793
Sine of 90 degrees is: 1.0
Natural logarithm of 10 is: 2.302585092994046
Logarithm of 100 with base 10 is: 2.0
```

## Python Style Guide

> Code is read far more often than it is written. — Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language.

Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as the primary style guide. This document outlines the coding conventions for Python code in the core standard library of the main Python distribution.

-   Employ descriptive names for variables and functions. Avoid abbreviations or single-letter names unless they are widely conventional (e.g., i as a loop index).

-   Organize code with consistent sectioning and clear headers or separators to enhance readability.

-   Restrict line length to a maximum of 79 characters to ensure compatibility with print media and prevent horizontal overflow.

-   Include meaningful inline comments where necessary to explain the purpose and intent of the code, particularly for complex logic.

Many modern Python projects enhance PEP 8 compliance by employing [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the uncompromising code formatter. Black applies a deterministic style that is a strict subset of PEP 8, with a default line length of 88 characters for improved readability on contemporary displays. It can be configured to use 79 characters if required.

The following scripts illustrate the earlier examples in accordance with PEP 8 guidelines:

``` python
"""
Degrees-Radians Conversion
"""

import math

# Conversion from degrees to radians
input_degrees = 180.0
converted_radians = math.radians(input_degrees)

# Conversion from radians to degrees
input_radians = math.pi
converted_degrees = math.degrees(input_radians)

# Display results
print("Degrees to Radians Conversion:")
print(f"{input_degrees:.0f} degrees = {converted_radians:.3f} radians")
print()
print("Radians to Degrees Conversion:")
print(f"{input_radians:.3f} radians = {converted_degrees:.1f} degrees")
```

``` python
"""
Math Module Examples

square root, pi constant, sine, natural logarithm, 
and base-10 logarithm.
"""

import math

# Compute and display mathematical operations
sqrt_result = math.sqrt(16)
pi_value = math.pi
sine_90_degrees = math.sin(math.pi / 2)  # 90 degrees = π/2 radians
natural_log_10 = math.log(10)
log_base10_100 = math.log(100, 10)

# Display results with clear descriptions
print("Square root of 16 is:", sqrt_result)
print("Value of pi is:", pi_value)
print("Sine of 90 degrees is:", sine_90_degrees)
print("Natural logarithm of 10 is:", natural_log_10)
print("Logarithm of 100 with base 10 is:", log_base10_100)
```
