## Problem Statement

A mild steel tank of wall thickness 10 mm contains water at 90 °C. Calculate the rate of heat loss per m² of tank surface area when the temperature is 15 °C. Given parameters:

-   Thermal conductivity of steel, $k = 50 \, \text{W/mK}$
-   Heat transfer coefficient for water, $h_{\text{water}} = 2800 \, \text{W/m² K}$
-   Heat transfer coefficient for air, $h_{\text{air}} = 11 \, \text{W/m² K}$
-   Wall thickness of tank, $t = 10 \, \text{mm} = 0.01 \, \text{m}$
-   Temperature of water, $T_{\text{water}} = 90^\circ C$
-   Temperature of air, $T_{\text{air}} = 15^\circ C$

We need to calculate the rate of heat loss per unit surface area.

## Solution

The rate of heat loss can be calculated using the concept of thermal resistance. For a cylindrical tank, the heat transfer resistance consists of two parts: the resistance due to the tank's steel walls and the resistance due to convection from the water and air.

The total heat transfer rate per unit area is given by:

$$
Q = \frac{T_{\text{water}} - T_{\text{air}}}{R_{\text{total}}}
$$

Where $R_{\text{total}}$ is the total thermal resistance, which is the sum of the resistance due to conduction through the steel and the convective resistances at both the water and air interfaces.

### Step 1: Thermal Resistance due to Conduction through Steel

The resistance due to conduction through the steel tank is given by:

$$
R_{\text{conduction}} = \frac{t}{k}
$$

Where: - $t$ is the wall thickness of the tank, - $k$ is the thermal conductivity of steel.

Substituting the known values:

$$
R_{\text{conduction}} = \frac{0.01 \, \text{m}}{50 \, \text{W/mK}} = 0.0002 \, \text{m² K/W}
$$

### Step 2: Convective Resistance due to Water

The resistance due to convection from the water to the tank wall is given by:

$$
R_{\text{conv, water}} = \frac{1}{h_{\text{water}}}
$$

Where $h_{\text{water}}$ is the heat transfer coefficient for water.

Substituting the known values:

$$
R_{\text{conv, water}} = \frac{1}{2800 \, \text{W/m² K}} = 0.000357 \, \text{m² K/W}
$$

### Step 3: Convective Resistance due to Air

The resistance due to convection from the tank wall to the air is given by:

$$
R_{\text{conv, air}} = \frac{1}{h_{\text{air}}}
$$

Where $h_{\text{air}}$ is the heat transfer coefficient for air.

Substituting the known values:

$$
R_{\text{conv, air}} = \frac{1}{11 \, \text{W/m² K}} = 0.09091 \, \text{m² K/W}
$$

### Step 4: Total Thermal Resistance

The total thermal resistance is the sum of the conduction and convection resistances:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{conduction}} + R_{\text{conv, water}} + R_{\text{conv, air}}
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 0.0002 + 0.000357 + 0.09091 = 0.091467 \, \text{m² K/W}
$$

### Step 5: Rate of Heat Loss

Finally, the rate of heat loss per unit surface area is:

$$
Q = \frac{T_{\text{water}} - T_{\text{air}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{90 - 15}{0.091467}
$$

Calculating the result:

$$
Q = \frac{75}{0.091467} \approx 819.5 \, \text{W/m²}
$$

## Conclusion

The rate of heat loss per square meter of the tank's surface area is approximately **819.5 W/m²**.
