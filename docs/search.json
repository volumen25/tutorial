    "text": "First and foremost, solve the problem sets using only pen, paper, and a calculator. After completing a problem by hand, slightly modify the conditions or variables and solve it again. Then, input the new values into the Python script and compare the results with your hand-calculated solution.\nBuddy system: Study with a classmate. Teaching and helping one another significantly deepens understanding of the material. Students are strongly encouraged to work through problem sets collaboratively. For example, one student solves the odd-numbered problems while the other solves the even-numbered ones; then each explains their solutions to the other.\nPractice, practice, practice! As the saying goes, “practice makes perfect”. More accurately in this context, “good practice makes perfect.” That means pen-and-paper-first practice. Use Python as a verification tool, not a crutch. Always derive the solution analytically on paper first. Only after obtaining a complete hand-calculated result should you run the corresponding Python script.\nMaintain a solution notebook: For each major problem, keep a single document (physical or digital) containing:\n\nThe full hand derivation\n\nKey numerical results with units\n\nA brief paragraph summarizing insights or reconciling any intermediate discrepancies\n\nThis record becomes an invaluable review resource before exams.",

    "text": "Requirements\nThis tutorial introduces Python programming, covering basic concepts with examples to illustrate key points. We will start by using Python as a calculator, then explore variables, functions, and control flow.\nTo follow this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is by using a web-based Python environment. This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend python-fiddle.com, an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.\nIf you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have Python(version 3.10 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code. I recommend Positron, a beginner-friendly IDE with a built-in terminal, though other editors like VS Code or PyCharm are also great options.",

You can use multiple elif statements to test multiple conditions sequentially, and Python will execute the first True condition’s block, skipping the rest.\nelse: Executes a code block if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are True. It serves as a fallback and does not require a condition.\n\nThe following example uses age to categorize a person as a Minor, Adult, or Senior, demonstrating how if, elif, and else work together.\n# Categorize a person based on their age\nage = 19\nif age &lt; 18:\n    print(\"Minor\")\nelif age &lt;= 64:\n    print(\"Adult\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Senior\")\nOutput: Adult\n\n\nFor Loop\nA for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list or string).\ncomponents = [\"piston\", \"liner\", \"connecting rod\"]\nfor component in components:\n    print(component)\nOutput:\npiston\nliner\nconnecting rod\n\n\nWhile Loop\nA while loop executes as long as a condition is true.
