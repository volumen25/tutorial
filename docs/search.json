This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend python-fiddle.com, an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.\nIf you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have Python (version 3.10 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code.

    "section": "1.2 Unity Fraction",
    "text": "1.2 Unity Fraction\nThe unity fraction method, or unit conversion using unity fractions, is a systematic way to convert one unit of measurement into another. This method relies on multiplying by fractions that are equal to one, where the numerator and the denominator represent the same quantity in different units. Since any number multiplied by one remains the same, unity fractions allow for seamless conversion without changing the value.\nThe principle of unity fractions is based on:\n\nSetting up equal values: Write a fraction where the numerator and denominator are equivalent values in different units, so the fraction equals one. For example, \\(\\frac{1km}{1000m}\\) is a unity fraction because 1 km equals 1000 m.\nMultiplying by unity fractions: Multiply the initial quantity by the unity fraction(s) so that the undesired units cancel out, leaving only the desired units.\n\n\n1.2.1 Classwork\n\nExample 1.1 Suppose we want to convert \\(5\\) kilometers to meters.\n\nStart with \\(5\\) kilometers: \\[\n5 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\nMultiply by a unity fraction that cancels kilometers and introduces meters. We use \\((\\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}}), since\\:1 \\, \\text{km} = 1000 \\, \\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[5 \\, \\text{km} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThe kilometers \\(\\text{km}\\) cancel out, leaving us with meters \\(\\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[\n5 \\, \\text{km} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\nThis step-by-step approach illustrates how the unity fraction cancels the undesired units and achieves the correct result in meters.\nUnity fractions can be extended by using multiple conversion steps. For example, converting hours to seconds would require two unity fractions: one to convert hours to minutes and another to convert minutes to seconds. This approach ensures accuracy and is widely used in science, engineering, and other fields that require precise unit conversions.\n\n\nExample 1.2 Convert \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) to \\(\\text{km/h}\\).\n\nStart with \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\nTo convert meters to kilometers, multiply by \\(\\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}}\\).\nTo convert seconds to hours, multiply by \\(\\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}}\\).\n\n\\[\n15 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}} \\times \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}} = 54 \\, \\text{km/h}\n\\]\nThe meters and seconds cancel out, leaving kilometers per hour: \\(54 \\, \\text{km/h}\\).\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Self-Test\nInstructions:\n\nUse unity fraction to convert between derived SI units.\nShow each step of your work to ensure accuracy.\nSimplify your answers and include correct units.\n\n\n\nSpeed\nConvert \\(72 \\, \\text{km/h}\\) to \\(\\text{m/s}\\).\nForce\nConvert \\(980 \\, \\text{N}\\) (newtons) to \\(\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2\\).\nEnergy\nConvert \\(2500 \\, \\text{J}\\) (joules) to \\(\\text{kJ}\\).\nPower\nConvert \\(1500 \\, \\text{W}\\) (watts) to \\(\\text{kW}\\).\nPressure\nConvert \\(101325 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) (pascals) to \\(\\text{kPa}\\).\nVolume Flow Rate\nConvert \\(3 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{min}\\) to \\(\\text{L/s}\\).\nDensity\nConvert \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) to \\(\\text{g/cm}^3\\).\nAcceleration\nConvert \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) to \\(\\text{cm/s}^2\\).\nTorque\nConvert \\(50 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}\\) to \\(\\text{kN} \\cdot \\text{cm}\\).\nFrequency\nConvert \\(500 \\, \\text{Hz}\\) (hertz) to \\(\\text{kHz}\\).\nWork to Energy Conversion\nA force of \\(20 \\, \\text{N}\\) moves an object \\(500 \\, \\text{cm}\\).

    "text": "2.5 Convection Heat Transfer\nConvection transfers heat through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases). When a fluid is heated, it expands, becomes less dense, and rises, while cooler, denser fluid moves in to replace it, creating a convection current that distributes heat.\nNatural convection occurs without mechanical aid, whereas forced convection involves devices such as pumps or fans. When fluid movement is driven by a pump or fan, heat is transferred by forced convection. Examples include:\n\nA pump circulating hot water through a building’s heating system,\nA fan forcing air through an automobile radiator, or\nA forced draft fan pushing hot gases through a boiler.\n\nThe total heat transferred between a solid surface and a moving fluid over a specified time is given by:\n\\[\nQ = h_A \\, A \\, t \\, (T_s - T_f)\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Q\\) = total heat transferred (J)\n\\(h_A\\) = surface (convective) heat transfer coefficient (\\(\\text{W/m}^2\\text{·K}\\))\n\\(A\\) = surface area of heat transfer (\\(\\text{m}^2\\))\n\\(t\\) = time during which heat transfer occurs (s), with \\(t = 1 \\, \\text{s}\\) for unit time\n\\(T_s\\) = surface temperature of the solid (K or °C)\n\\(T_f\\) = temperature of the surrounding fluid (K or °C)\n\nThis equation describes how heat energy is transferred between a surface and a fluid over a unit time of 1 second, depending on the temperature difference, the surface area, the time, and the fluid’s heat-carrying effectiveness, represented by the convective heat transfer coefficient (\\(h_A\\))",
