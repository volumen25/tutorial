    "text": "First and foremost, solve the problem sets using only pen, paper, and a calculator. After completing a problem by hand, slightly modify the conditions or variables and solve it again. Then, input the new values into the Python script and compare the results with your hand-calculated solution.\n\nBuddy system: Study with a classmate. Teaching and helping one another significantly deepens understanding of the material. Students are strongly encouraged to work through problem sets collaboratively. For example, one student solves the odd-numbered problems while the other solves the even-numbered ones; then each explains their solutions to the other.\nPractice, practice, practice: As the saying goes, “practice makes perfect.” More accurately in this context, “good practice makes perfect.” That means pen-and-paper-first practice. Use Python as a verification tool, not a crutch. Always derive the solution analytically on paper first. Only after obtaining a complete hand-calculated result should you run the corresponding Python script. This approach echoes a proverb commonly attributed to Confucius:\n\nI hear and I forget\nI see and I remember\nI do and I understand\n\nMaintain a solution notebook: For each major problem, keep a single document (physical or digital) containing:\n\nThe full hand derivation\n\nKey numerical results with units\n\nA brief paragraph summarizing insights or reconciling any intermediate discrepancies\n\nThis record becomes an invaluable review resource before exams.",

We will start by using Python as a calculator, then explore variables, functions, and control flow.\nTo follow this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is by using a web-based Python environment. This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend python-fiddle.com, an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.\nIf you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have Python (version 3.10 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code.

    "section": "1.2 Unity Fraction",
    "text": "1.2 Unity Fraction\nThe unity fraction method, or unit conversion using unity fractions, is a systematic way to convert one unit of measurement into another. This method relies on multiplying by fractions that are equal to one, where the numerator and the denominator represent the same quantity in different units. Since any number multiplied by one remains the same, unity fractions allow for seamless conversion without changing the value.\nThe principle of unity fractions is based on:\n\nSetting up equal values: Write a fraction where the numerator and denominator are equivalent values in different units, so the fraction equals one. For example, \\(\\frac{1km}{1000m}\\) is a unity fraction because 1 km equals 1000 m.\nMultiplying by unity fractions: Multiply the initial quantity by the unity fraction(s) so that the undesired units cancel out, leaving only the desired units.\n\n\n1.2.1 Classwork\n\nExample 1.1 Suppose we want to convert \\(5\\) kilometers to meters.\n\nStart with \\(5\\) kilometers: \\[\n5 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\nMultiply by a unity fraction that cancels kilometers and introduces meters. We use \\((\\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}}), since\\:1 \\, \\text{km} = 1000 \\, \\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[5 \\, \\text{km} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThe kilometers \\(\\text{km}\\) cancel out, leaving us with meters \\(\\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[\n5 \\, \\text{km} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\nThis step-by-step approach illustrates how the unity fraction cancels the undesired units and achieves the correct result in meters.\nUnity fractions can be extended by using multiple conversion steps. For example, converting hours to seconds would require two unity fractions: one to convert hours to minutes and another to convert minutes to seconds. This approach ensures accuracy and is widely used in science, engineering, and other fields that require precise unit conversions.\n\n\nExample 1.2 Convert \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) to \\(\\text{km/h}\\).\n\nStart with \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\nTo convert meters to kilometers, multiply by \\(\\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}}\\).\nTo convert seconds to hours, multiply by \\(\\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}}\\).\n\n\\[\n15 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}} \\times \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}} = 54 \\, \\text{km/h}\n\\]\nThe meters and seconds cancel out, leaving kilometers per hour: \\(54 \\, \\text{km/h}\\).\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Self-Test\nInstructions:\n\nUse unity fraction to convert between derived SI units.\nShow each step of your work to ensure accuracy.\nSimplify your answers and include correct units.\n\n\n\nSpeed\nConvert \\(72 \\, \\text{km/h}\\) to \\(\\text{m/s}\\).\nForce\nConvert \\(980 \\, \\text{N}\\) (newtons) to \\(\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2\\).\nEnergy\nConvert \\(2500 \\, \\text{J}\\) (joules) to \\(\\text{kJ}\\).\nPower\nConvert \\(1500 \\, \\text{W}\\) (watts) to \\(\\text{kW}\\).\nPressure\nConvert \\(101325 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) (pascals) to \\(\\text{kPa}\\).\nVolume Flow Rate\nConvert \\(3 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{min}\\) to \\(\\text{L/s}\\).\nDensity\nConvert \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) to \\(\\text{g/cm}^3\\).\nAcceleration\nConvert \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) to \\(\\text{cm/s}^2\\).\nTorque\nConvert \\(50 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}\\) to \\(\\text{kN} \\cdot \\text{cm}\\).\nFrequency\nConvert \\(500 \\, \\text{Hz}\\) (hertz) to \\(\\text{kHz}\\).\nWork to Energy Conversion\nA force of \\(20 \\, \\text{N}\\) moves an object \\(500 \\, \\text{cm}\\).

When most substances are heated, their particles move more vigorously and tend to occupy more space, leading to an increase in dimensions. Conversely, when substances are cooled, they generally contract. This phenomenon occurs in solids, liquids, and gases, although the degree and nature of expansion vary depending on the material’s state and properties.\nThis occurs along a specific dimension or direction, primarily in long, narrow objects (like rods or beams). When the temperature of a solid object increases, its length expands by an amount proportional to its original length and the temperature change.

    "text": "5.1 Boyle’s Law\nThe terms “perfect gas” and “ideal gas” are often used interchangeably in physics and engineering, but “ideal gas” is the more standard term in modern scientific literature.\nAn ideal gas is a theoretical model that remains in the gaseous state under all conditions, as it does not account for phase changes such as condensation. Real gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and dry air, are often approximated as ideal gases under typical conditions (e.g., low pressures and high temperatures relative to their critical points), but they may condense under extreme conditions. Saturated steam, being at the liquid-vapor phase boundary, does not behave as an ideal gas due to significant intermolecular forces, whereas superheated steam approximates ideal gas behavior when sufficiently far from its condensation point.\nIn an ideal gas, pressure, temperature, and volume are interrelated, enabling the calculation of changes in one property based on the others. These relationships are governed by Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and the ideal gas law, which collectively describe the behavior of an ideal gas under varying conditions.\nRobert Boyle (1627–1691), a physicist, investigated the behavior of an ideal gas at constant temperature. By controlling the addition or removal of heat during changes in the volume and pressure of a confined gas, he maintained a constant temperature. He discovered that, under these conditions, the absolute pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume. That is, as the volume increases, the pressure decreases, and conversely, as the volume decreases, the pressure increases. This can be stated as:\\index{Boyle’s Law}.\n\\[\nP\\propto\\frac{1}{V}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]",

This means that as the temperature of a gas increases, its volume increases proportionally, provided the pressure remains constant. Conversely, as the temperature decreases, the volume decreases. The law assumes the gas behaves as an ideal gas. This can be stated as:\\index{Charles’s Law}.\n\\[\nV\\propto\\ T\n\\tag{5.2}\\]",
