    "text": "Requirements\nThis tutorial introduces Python programming, covering basic concepts with examples to illustrate key points. We will start by using Python as a calculator, then explore variables, functions, and control flow.\nTo follow this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is by using a web-based Python environment. This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend python-fiddle.com, an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.\nIf you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have Python(version 3.10 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code. I recommend Positron, a beginner-friendly IDE with a built-in terminal, though other editors like VS Code or PyCharm are also great options.",

You can use multiple elif statements to test multiple conditions sequentially, and Python will execute the first True condition’s block, skipping the rest.\nelse: Executes a code block if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are True. It serves as a fallback and does not require a condition.\n\nThe following example uses age to categorize a person as a Minor, Adult, or Senior, demonstrating how if, elif, and else work together.\n# Categorize a person based on their age\nage = 19\nif age &lt; 18:\n    print(\"Minor\")\nelif age &lt;= 64:\n    print(\"Adult\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Senior\")\nOutput: Adult\n\n\nFor Loop\nA for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list or string).\ncomponents = [\"piston\", \"liner\", \"connecting rod\"]\nfor component in components:\n    print(component)\nOutput:\npiston\nliner\nconnecting rod\n\n\nWhile Loop\nA while loop executes as long as a condition is true.
