    "text": "First and foremost, solve the problem sets using only pen, paper, and a calculator. After completing a problem by hand, slightly modify the conditions or variables and solve it again. Then, input the new values into the Python script and compare the results with your hand-calculated solution.\nBuddy system: Study with a classmate. Teaching and helping one another significantly deepens understanding of the material. Students are strongly encouraged to work through problem sets collaboratively. For example, one student solves the odd-numbered problems while the other solves the even-numbered ones; then each explains their solutions to the other.\nPractice, practice, practice! As the saying goes, “practice makes perfect”. More accurately in this context, “good practice makes perfect.” That means pen-and-paper-first practice. Use Python as a verification tool, not a crutch. Always derive the solution analytically on paper first. Only after obtaining a complete hand-calculated result should you run the corresponding Python script.\nMaintain a solution notebook: For each major problem, keep a single document (physical or digital) containing:\n\nThe full hand derivation\n\nKey numerical results with units\n\nA brief paragraph summarizing insights or reconciling any intermediate discrepancies\n\nThis record becomes an invaluable review resource before exams.",

We will start by using Python as a calculator, then explore variables, functions, and control flow.\nTo follow this tutorial, the easiest way to get started is by using a web-based Python environment. This lets you write and run Python code right in your browser; no downloads or setup needed. I recommend python-fiddle.com, an easy-to-use online editor that lets you experiment with Python instantly and solve your problem sets effortlessly.\nIf you prefer working on your own computer, make sure you have Python (version 3.10 or later) installed. Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code. I recommend Positron, a beginner-friendly IDE with a built-in terminal, though other editors like VS Code or PyCharm are also good options.",

This chapter examines situations where forces produce acceleration, and it presents methods for analyzing the resulting motion, including the application of Newton’s laws, energy principles, and momentum conservation.\nInertia is the property of a body that resists any change in its state of motion and is directly proportional to its mass. It can be understood as a form of “sluggishness” inherent to matter. For an object at rest, a net force is required to set it in motion; the greater the mass, the greater the force needed. Similarly, if an object is already moving, a net force is required to change its speed or direction, and the magnitude of this force is again proportional to the mass.\nThe term “inertia” is also used in structural mechanics to describe the resistance of a beam’s cross-section to bending, quantified by the second moment of area (see lecture notes on Second Moments).",

    "text": "3.4 Linear momentum\nLinear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies the motion of an object. It is defined as the product of the object’s mass and its velocity. Because momentum is a vector quantity, it possesses both magnitude and direction.\n\\[\nLinear\\ momentum = m \\vec{v}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nLinear momentum is in kg·m/s.\n\\(m\\) is the mass of the object in kilograms.\n\\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the object in meters per second.\n\n\n3.4.1 Conservation of Linear Momentum\nThe law of conservation of linear momentum states that, in a closed system with no external forces (or when the net external force is zero), the total linear momentum remains constant over time. This principle is particularly evident in collisions between two bodies. During a collision, the force exerted by the first body on the second is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second on the first (Newton’s third law). These equal and opposite forces act for the same duration, producing changes in momentum that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Consequently, the momentum gained by one body exactly equals the momentum lost by the other. Therefore, the total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.\nIn the absence of external forces, linear momentum is neither created nor destroyed; it is conserved. This is known as the law of conservation of linear momentum.\n\nExample 3.3 A hand hammer with a head mass of 0.8 kg strikes a chisel at 9 m/s and comes to rest in 1/250 seconds. Calculate the average force exerted during the blow.\n# Given\n\nm = 0.8               # kg\nu = 9                 # m/s (initial velocity)\nv = 0                 # m/s (final velocity)\nt = 1/250             # s (time to come to rest)\n\n# Change in momentum\n\ndelta_p = m * (v - u)\n\n# Average force\n\nF_avg = delta_p / t\n\nprint(f\"Average force during the blow: {F_avg:.4f} N\")\n\n\nExample 3.4 A jet of fresh water, 20 mm in diameter, emerges horizontally from a nozzle at a speed of 21 m/s and strikes a stationary vertical plate normally. Assuming no splashback (i.e., the water comes to rest upon impact with no velocity component normal to the plate after striking), calculate: (a) the mass flow rate of water leaving the nozzle (in kg/s), and (b) the force exerted by the jet on the plate.

    "text": "3.5 Angular Momentum\nAngular momentum is the moment of linear momentum about a chosen point or axis. For a single particle, it is given by the cross product of its position vector (measured from that point) and its linear momentum.\nMore broadly, angular momentum measures the rotational motion of a system. For extended bodies, its evaluation depends on both the distance of mass elements from the axis (the first moment of position) and how the mass is distributed throughout the object—the moment of inertia, or second moment of mass.\n\n\n\nAngular momentum\n\n\nGiven linear velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) and angular velocity \\(\\omega\\):\n\\[\n\\vec{v} = r \\omega\n\\]\nThe linear momentum is determined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Linear momentum} = m \\vec{v}\n\\]\nSubstituting for \\(\\vec{v}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Linear momentum} = m r \\omega\n\\]\nThe moment of linear momentum can then be written as:\n\\[\n\\text{Moment of linear momentum} = m r \\omega r\n\\]\nThe moment of linear momentum is referred to as the angular momentum. Simplifying the above equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Angular momentum} = m r^2 \\omega\n\\]\nHere, \\(m r^2\\) is the moment of inertia (second moment of mass) of the object about its axis of rotation, denoted as \\(I\\). Thus, the angular momentum can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Angular momentum} = I \\omega\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(I\\) is the moment of inertia in \\(kg·m²\\).\n\\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity in \\(rad/s\\).\n\nAdditionally, the moment of inertia \\(I\\) is given by:\n\\[\nI = m k^2\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(I\\) is the moment of inertia in \\(kg·m²\\).\n\\(m\\) is the mass in \\(kg\\).\n\\(k\\) is the radius of gyration in \\(m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn structural engineering, the moment of inertia (m⁴) is a measure of resistance to bending (deflection or stiffness).\nIn angular motion and physics, the moment of inertia (kg·m²) is a measure of resistance to angular acceleration (rotational inertia).",

    "text": "3.6 The Radius of Gyration\nThe radius of gyration is a geometric property of a rigid body or mass distribution that describes how the mass is distributed relative to an axis of rotation. It represents the effective distance from the axis at which the entire mass could be concentrated while producing the same moment of inertia as the actual distributed mass.\nIn simpler terms, a smaller radius of gyration means the mass is closer to the axis, which is good for reducing inertia in rotating machinery. This is desirable in applications like engine crankshafts or turbine rotors where rapid changes in speed are required. A larger radius of gyration means the mass is farther from the axis, like a hollow cylinder has a larger k than a solid cylinder of the same mass and outer radius. This is beneficial when energy storage is needed (e.g., flywheels).\n\nExample 3.5 A flywheel of mass 500 kg and radius of gyration 1.2 m is running at 300 rev/min. By means of a clutch, this flywheel is suddenly connected to another flywheel, mass 2000 kg and radius of gyration 0.6 m, initially at rest. Calculate their common speed of rotation after engagement.\nimport math\n\n# Given data\n\nm1, k1 = 500, 1.2\nm2, k2 = 2000, 0.6\nrpm1 = 300\n\n# Moments of inertia\n\nI1 = m1 * k1**2\nI2 = m2 * k2**2\n\n# Convert rpm to rad/s\n\nomega1 = (rpm1 / 60) * 2 * math.pi\n\n# Conservation of angular momentum\n\nomega_f = (I1 * omega1) / (I1 + I2)\n\n# Convert rad/s to rpm\n\nrpm_f = (omega_f / (2 * math.pi)) * 60\n\nprint(f\"Final angular velocity (rad/s): {omega_f:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Final angular velocity (rpm): {rpm_f:.4f}\")",
