## Linear Motion Definitions

-   $\textbf{Speed} (v)$: The scalar measure of the rate of change of distance. Mathematically, $$
      v = \frac{d}{t}
      $$ where (d) is distance and (t) is time.

-   $\textbf{Velocity} (\vec{v})$: The vector measure of the rate of change of displacement. It is given by: $$
      \vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}
      $$ where $\Delta \vec{x}$ is the displacement vector and $\Delta t$ is the time interval.

-   $\textbf{Acceleration} (\vec{a})$: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It is defined as: $$
      \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
      $$

A ship's engines are stopped when travelling at a speed of 18 knots, and the ship comes to rest after 20 min. Assuming uniform deceleration, find the deceleration (m/s²) and the distance travelled in nautical miles in that time.

``` python
import math

# Given

v_knots = 18           # initial speed in knots
t_minutes = 20         # time to stop in minutes
kn_to_ms = 0.5144      # conversion factor (m/s per knot)
nmi_in_m = 1852        # meters in a nautical mile

# Convert units

vi = v_knots * kn_to_ms      # initial speed in m/s
vf = 0                       # final speed
t = t_minutes * 60           # seconds

# Deceleration (positive magnitude)

deceleration = (vi - vf) / t     # m/s^2

# Average velocity for uniform deceleration

v_avg = (vi + vf) / 2            # m/s

# Distance travelled

s = v_avg * t                    # meters
s_nmi = s / nmi_in_m             # nautical miles

## Equations of Motion (Constant Acceleration)

$$
\vec{v} = \vec{u} + \vec{a}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \frac{\vec{u}+\vec{v}}{2}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \vec{u}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2
$$

$$
\vec{v}^2 = \vec{u}^2 + 2\vec{a} \cdot \vec{s}
$$

where:

-   $\vec{u}$: Initial velocity
-   $\vec{v}$: Final velocity
-   $\vec{s}$: Displacement
-   $\vec{a}$: Acceleration
-   $t$: Time

::: {#exm-river}
A boat is rowed at 6 km/h perpendicular to a river flowing at 4 km/h. The river is 50 meters wide. How far downstream will the boat reach the opposite bank? What is the boat’s actual velocity (magnitude and direction)?

We treat this as vector addition: the boat's rowing velocity across the river and the river's current velocity downstream.

Given

-   Boat speed across: $v_b = 6\ \text{km/h}$

-   River current speed: $v_c = 4\ \text{km/h}$

-   River width: $w = 50\ \text{m}$

Convert speeds to m/s:

$$
1\ \text{km/h} = \frac{1000}{3600} = 0.277777\ \text{m/s}
$$

$$
v_b = 6 \times 0.277777 = 1.6666667\ \text{m/s}
$$

$$
v_c = 4 \times 0.277777 = 1.1111111\ \text{m/s}
$$

Time to cross the river

$$
t = \frac{w}{v_b} = \frac{50}{1.6666667} = 30\ \text{s}
$$

Downstream drift

$$
\text{drift} = v_c \times t = 1.1111111 \times 30 = 33.3333\ \text{m}
$$

Actual velocity magnitude $$
v = \sqrt{v_b^2 + v_c^2} = 2.00308\ \text{m/s}
$$

Direction (downstream from perpendicular)

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\!\left( \frac{v_c}{v_b} \right) = 33.69
$$

``` python
import math

# Given
boat_speed_kmh = 6      # km/h (perpendicular to river)
current_speed_kmh = 4   # km/h (downstream)
width = 50              # meters (river width)

# Convert speeds to m/s

boat_speed = boat_speed_kmh * 1000 / 3600
current_speed = current_speed_kmh * 1000 / 3600

# Time to cross

t = width / boat_speed

# Downstream drift

drift = current_speed * t

# Actual velocity (magnitude)

v_actual = math.sqrt(boat_speed**2 + current_speed**2)

# Convert to km/h

v_actual_kmh = v_actual * 3.6

# Direction (downstream from perpendicular)

theta_deg = math.degrees(math.atan(current_speed / boat_speed))

-   $\textbf{Angular Velocity} (\omega)$: The rate of change of angular displacement. Mathematically: $$
        \omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
        $$ $$
    \omega (rad/s) =2\pi n \:where\:n=speed\:in\:rev/s

-   $\textbf{Angular Acceleration} (\alpha)$: The rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time: $$
         \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
         $$

## Equations of Angular Motion (Constant Angular Acceleration)

## Relation Between Linear and Angular Motion

The relationship between linear and angular motion is described by the following equations:

$s = r \theta$ (linear displacement $s$ and angular displacement $\theta$).

$v = r \omega$ (linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\omega$).

$a = r \alpha$ (linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$).

### Variables

-   $v$: Linear velocity, the rate of change of linear displacement $(v = \frac{ds}{dt})$.

-   $a$: Linear acceleration, the rate of change of linear velocity $(a = \frac{dv}{dt})$.

-   $s$: Linear displacement, the distance moved along the circular path.

-   $r$: Radius of the circular path.

-   $\omega$: Angular velocity, the rate of change of angular displacement $(\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt})$.

-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration, the rate of change of angular velocity $(\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt})$.

-   $\theta$: Angular displacement, the angle swept by the radius in radians.

## Summary

-   Linear motion is directly proportional to angular motion, with the radius ($r$) acting as the proportionality constant.

-   Units for the variables:

    -   $v$: meters per second $(m/s)$,

    -   $a$: meters per second squared $(m/s^2)$,

    -   $s$: meters $(m)$,

    -   $r$: meters $(m)$,

    -   $\omega$: radians per second $(rad/s)$,

    -   $\alpha$: radians per second squared $(rad/s^2)$,

    -   $\theta$: radians ($rad$).
