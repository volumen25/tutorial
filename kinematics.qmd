## Linear Motion Definitions

-   $\textbf{Speed} (v)$: The scalar measure of the rate of change of distance. Mathematically, $$
      v = \frac{d}{t}
      $$ where (d) is distance and (t) is time.

-   $\textbf{Velocity} (\vec{v})$: The vector measure of the rate of change of displacement. It is given by: $$
      \vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}
      $$ where $\Delta \vec{x}$ is the displacement vector and $\Delta t$ is the time interval.

-   $\textbf{Acceleration} (\vec{a})$: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It is defined as: $$
      \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
      $$

A ship's engines are stopped when travelling at a speed of 18 knots, and the ship comes to rest after 20 min. Assuming uniform deceleration, find the deceleration (m/s²) and the distance travelled in nautical miles in that time.

``` python
import math

# Given

v_knots = 18           # initial speed in knots
t_minutes = 20         # time to stop in minutes
kn_to_ms = 0.5144      # conversion factor (m/s per knot)
nmi_in_m = 1852        # meters in a nautical mile

# Convert units

vi = v_knots * kn_to_ms      # initial speed in m/s
vf = 0                       # final speed
t = t_minutes * 60           # seconds

# Deceleration (positive magnitude)

deceleration = (vi - vf) / t     # m/s^2

# Average velocity for uniform deceleration

v_avg = (vi + vf) / 2            # m/s

# Distance travelled

s = v_avg * t                    # meters
s_nmi = s / nmi_in_m             # nautical miles

print(f"Deceleration: {deceleration:.6f} m/s^2")
print(f"Distance travelled: {s_nmi:.3f} nautical miles")

## Equations of Motion (Constant Acceleration)

$$
\vec{v} = \vec{u} + \vec{a}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \frac{\vec{u}+\vec{v}}{2}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \vec{u}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2
$$

$$
\vec{v}^2 = \vec{u}^2 + 2\vec{a} \cdot \vec{s}
$$

where:

-   $\vec{u}$: Initial velocity
-   $\vec{v}$: Final velocity
-   $\vec{s}$: Displacement
-   $\vec{a}$: Acceleration
-   $t$: Time

A ship’s propellers are stopped when travelling at 25 knots. From that point, it travels 4 kilometres before coming to a complete stop. Calculate the time it takes to stop in minutes and the average deceleration in m/s².

``` python
# Given

u_knots = 25          # initial speed in knots
v_knots = 0           # final speed in knots
s_m = 4000            # stopping distance in meters
kn_to_ms = 0.5144     # conversion factor knots to m/s

# Convert to m/s

u = u_knots * kn_to_ms
v = v_knots * kn_to_ms

# Average deceleration (from s = 1/2*(u+v)*t)

t = (2 * s_m) / (u + v)

# Deceleration using v = u - a*t

a = (u - v) / t        

# Convert time to minutes

t_minutes = t / 60

print(f"Average deceleration: {a:.5f} m/s²")
print(f"Time to stop: {t_minutes:.2f} minutes")

## Angular Motion Definitions

-   $\textbf{Angular Displacement} (\theta)$: The angle through which an object rotates, measured in radians.

    ![](images/angulardisp.png){width="310"}

-   $\textbf{Angular Velocity} (\omega)$: The rate of change of angular displacement. Mathematically: $$
        \omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
        $$ $$
    \omega (rad/s) =2\pi n \:where\:n=speed\:in\:rev/s
    $$

-   $\textbf{Angular Acceleration} (\alpha)$: The rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time: $$
         \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
         $$

## Equations of Angular Motion (Constant Angular Acceleration)

$$
\omega_2 = \omega_1 \mp \alpha t
$$

$$
\theta = \frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}t
$$

$$
\theta = \omega_1 t \mp \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2 
$$

$$
\omega_2^2 = \omega_1^2 \mp 2\alpha \theta
$$

where:

-   $\omega_1$: Initial angular velocity (rad/s)

-   $\omega_2$: Final angular velocity (rad/s)

-   $\theta$ Angular displacement (rad)

-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration (rad/s^2^)

-   $t$: Time (s)

A shaft is rotating at 40 revolutions per minute (rev/min). It is uniformly decelerated at a rate of 0.017 rad/s² for 15 seconds. Calculate: 1. The angular velocity of the shaft at the end of 15 seconds (in rad/s and rev/min). 2. The total number of revolutions completed by the shaft during these 15 seconds.

``` python
import math

# Given

omega1_rpm = 40 # initial angular speed in rev/min
alpha = -0.017  # angular acceleration (rad/s^2), (-) for deceleration
t = 15          # time in seconds

# Convert initial speed to rad/s

omega1 = omega1_rpm * 2 * math.pi / 60  

# Angular velocity after time t

omega2 = omega1 + alpha * t              

# Angular displacement during time t

theta = omega1 * t + 0.5 * alpha * t**2  

# Convert angular displacement to revolutions

revolutions = theta / (2 * math.pi)

# Convert omega2 to rpm

omega2_rpm = omega2 * 60 / (2 * math.pi)

print(f"Final angular velocity: {omega2:.4f} rad/s")
print(f"Final angular velocity: {omega2_rpm:.4f} rpm")
print(f"Angular displacement: {revolutions:.4f} revolutions")

## Relation Between Linear and Angular Motion

The relationship between linear and angular motion is described by the following equations:

$s = r \theta$ (linear displacement $s$ and angular displacement $\theta$).

$v = r \omega$ (linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\omega$).

$a = r \alpha$ (linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$).

### Variables

-   $v$: Linear velocity, the rate of change of linear displacement $(v = \frac{ds}{dt})$.

-   $a$: Linear acceleration, the rate of change of linear velocity $(a = \frac{dv}{dt})$.

-   $s$: Linear displacement, the distance moved along the circular path.

-   $r$: Radius of the circular path.

-   $\omega$: Angular velocity, the rate of change of angular displacement $(\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt})$.

-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration, the rate of change of angular velocity $(\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt})$.

-   $\theta$: Angular displacement, the angle swept by the radius in radians.

## Summary

-   Linear motion is directly proportional to angular motion, with the radius ($r$) acting as the proportionality constant.

-   Units for the variables:

    -   $v$: meters per second $(m/s)$,

    -   $a$: meters per second squared $(m/s^2)$,

    -   $s$: meters $(m)$,

    -   $r$: meters $(m)$,

    -   $\omega$: radians per second $(rad/s)$,

    -   $\alpha$: radians per second squared $(rad/s^2)$,

    -   $\theta$: radians ($rad$).
