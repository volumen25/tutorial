## Gauge Pressure

Pressure measured relative to atmospheric pressure.\
**Unit:** Pa (N/m²), kPa, bar.

## Vacuum Pressure

Pressure below atmospheric pressure; the magnitude by which the absolute pressure is less than atmospheric.\
**Unit:** Pa, kPa, bar.

## Absolute Pressure

Total pressure measured relative to a perfect vacuum:\
$$
P_{\text{abs}} = P_{\text{atm}} + P_{\text{gauge}}.
$$\
**Unit:** Pa, kPa, bar.

## Absolute Temperature

Temperature measured from absolute zero (0 K).

$$
T(\mathrm{K}) = T(°\mathrm{C}) + 273.15.
$$

**Unit:** Kelvin (K).

## Change of State

A physical transformation between solid, liquid, and gas without changing temperature (e.g., melting, boiling).\
**Unit:** No units; process description.

## Sensible Heat

Heat added or removed that changes temperature but **not** state.

$$
Q = mc\Delta T.
$$ **Unit:** joule (J).

## Specific Heat (Specific Heat Capacity)

Heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1°C (or 1 K).\
**Unit:** J/(kg·K).

## Latent Heat of Fusion

Heat required to convert 1 kg of a solid to liquid at constant temperature.\
**Unit:** J/kg.

## Latent Heat of Evaporation (Vaporization)

Heat required to convert 1 kg of liquid to vapor at constant temperature.\
**Unit:** J/kg.

## Water Equivalent of Mass

Mass of water that would absorb the same amount of heat as the body for the same temperature rise.\
$$
\text{Water equivalent} = mc_{\text{body}} / c_{\text{water}}.
$$ **Unit:** kg.

## Coefficient of Linear Expansion (α)

Fractional change in length per degree change in temperature:\
$$
\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T.
$$ **Unit:** 1/K (or °C⁻¹).

## Coefficient of Cubical Expansion (β)

Fractional change in volume per degree change in temperature:\
$$
\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T.
$$\
**Unit:** 1/K.

## Cubical Expansion and Apparent Cubical Expansion

-   **Real (Actual) Cubical Expansion:** Actual increase in volume of a liquid with temperature.\
-   **Apparent Cubical Expansion:** Observed expansion when liquid is heated in a container that also expands;\
    $$
    \beta_{\text{apparent}} = \beta_{\text{liquid}} - \beta_{\text{container}}.
    $$ **Unit:** 1/K.

## Thermal Conductivity (k)

Rate at which a material conducts heat through unit thickness per unit temperature difference:\
$$
q = kA \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}.
$$\
**Unit:** W/(m·K).

## Surface Heat Transfer Coefficient (h)

Rate of heat transfer per unit area per degree temperature difference between a surface and the surrounding fluid.\
**Unit:** W/(m²·K).

## Joule’s Law

The heat produced in a conductor due to an electric current is proportional to the square of the current, the resistance, and the time:\
$$
H = I^2 R t.
$$ **Unit:** J (for heat produced).
